react-es6-redux
===============

![image](http://dev.topheman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/logo-reactjs.png)

This project is a POC based on **React** framework, coded in **ES6**, relying on [topheman-apis-proxy](https://github.com/topheman/topheman-apis-proxy) as a backend (providing the github API) and using **redux** for state management.

This repo holds the front-only part.

* The version without redux remains on the [v1.x branch](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-redux/tree/v1.x).
* You can see the isomorphic (universal if you will) version (with server-side rendering) at [topheman/react-es6-isomorphic](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-isomorphic/) (based on v1 - not yet with redux at this time).

To read further about this project and its evolution:

* [Blog post about the original version](http://dev.topheman.com/playing-with-es6-and-react/)
* [Blog post about the upgrade to react v0.14](http://dev.topheman.com/upgraded-to-react-v0-14/)

###Basic features :

* `/` : Home page : Display a short description of the project with a try button to :
* `/github` : Provide a search form that displays a list of github users (with their avatars) - a request to the Github API is made.
* `/github/user/:username` : Display a user profile with his repositories, with pagination.

All state management is done via redux. In development mode, you have access to the [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) (you can also [test them on the online version](https://topheman.github.io/react-es6-redux/devtools.html)).

* react-router connected to redux-stores
* hot reload everything!
* redux-devtools

###Setup

####Install

The react-es6-redux part :

```shell
git clone https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-redux.git
cd react-es6-redux
npm install
```

You'll have to install the [topheman-apis-proxy](https://github.com/topheman/topheman-apis-proxy) backend, follow the [installation steps](https://github.com/topheman/topheman-apis-proxy#installation) README section.

####Run

* Open a terminal in the react-es6-redux folder and `npm run webpack-dev`
* Open a terminal in the topheman-apis-proxy folder and `grunt serve` (see more in the [run in local](https://github.com/topheman/topheman-apis-proxy#run-in-local) README section)
* Go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

You can also run the app in mock mode (without any backend - the http request are mocked), usefull for :

* working offline
* create unit tests without changing code
 
Just run : `npm run webpack-mock`


####Build

At the root of the project :

* for production (minified/optimized ...) : `npm run build-prod`
* for debug (like in dev - with sourceMaps and all) : `npm run build`

A `/build` folder will be created with your project built in it.

You can run it with `npm run serve-build`

#####Specific build

To provide a version with both production version and devtools version (with redux devtools & sourcemaps, I tweaked a little my build routine), you just have to `npm run build-prod-all`

###Steps :

Checkout the [releases sections](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-redux/releases).

You'll see the releases for both versions:

* original one (redux free) which is hold on [v1.x branch](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-redux/tree/v1.x)
* the version with the redux implementation which is on [master branch](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-redux)
